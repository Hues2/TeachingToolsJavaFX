# Teaching Tool

<hr/>

Teaching Tool is a piece of software that was created to help students learn basic algorithms and data structures.
<br>
To achieve this goal, the software provides different tools such as a visualisation tool, with different playback controls,
<br>
and a side panel with the algorithm description, pseudocode, and explanations of every step the algorithm takes.

The current version of Teaching Tool contains 3 different sorting algorithms:
<br>
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
