✖ Add shell sort

✖ Add quick sort

✖ Add a 3rd tab that has a useful teaching/learning tool

✖ Refactor code

✖ Track how much time it takes for the sorting algorithm to finish

✖ Create README

✖ Make bars that have swapped different colours
    Maybe track the differences between both arrays and change the colours of the bars that have
    swapped positions in the list

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✔ Make bubble sort algorithm visual

✔ Disable required buttons when list is being sorted

✔ Let user change speed of bubble sort algorithm

✔ Implement pause button

✔ Implement next button

✔ Implement previous button

✔ Implement reset button

✔ Implement the choice box

✔ Implement quicksort

✔ Make method that runs when user chooses what algorithm to use
    This will instantiate the chosen algorithm which will sort it
    and then add fill the listOfLists.
    Maybe call the reset method
    Find out how to call the chosen sorting algorithm from the reset menu

✔ Right now the sorting algorithm controller only uses bubble sort
    Make the choice box allow the user to pick what algorithm they want to see

✔ Make the algorithm explanation title change to the selected
    algorithm from the choice box

✔ Allow user to change number of bars

✔ Make text change on tab 1, depending on what algorithm is selected
    Maybe make a method that sets the text depending on the combo box index

✔ Make tab2 display
    Show each step (Make string that says "Step" + counter + ":")
        (then String that prints out the list of bars at index counter)

✔ Allow user to change the colour of the bars
    Maybe with the color picker
