✖ Make the algorithm explanation title change to the selected
    algorithm from the choice box

✖ Right now the sorting algorithm controller only uses bubble sort
    Make the choice box allow the user to pick what algorithm they want to see


✖ Implement the choice box

✖ Make method that runs when user chooses what algorithm to use
    This will instantiate the chosen algorithm which will sort it
    and then add fill the listOfLists.
    Maybe call the reset method
    Find out how to call the chosen sorting algorithm from the reset menu
